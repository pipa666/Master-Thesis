\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}
% Should I put many references, or a single main one is prefered?
During the last years, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have significantly evolved into systems capable of performing various natural language tasks \parencite{brown_language_2020}. More interestingly, they have shown emergent features as they are able to perform tasks that were not originally part, or expected, of the design \parencite{wei_emergent_2022}. Their ability to adapt for different tasks without requiring exhaustive re-design of their architectures, combined with their potential to serve as building blocks for task-specific Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, has led researchers to classify them as a general purpose technology \parencite{eloundou_gpts_2023}. 

These developments have the potential to facilitate a broader use of more straightforward, localized, and task-specific AI tools \parencite{bubeck_sparks_2023}. Given that state-of-the-art models do not require advanced technical programming skills, professionals from different domains might now tailor customized tools that align closely with their contexts, needs, and specialized approaches \parencite{cain_gpteammate_2023}. Andrew Ng, a leading expert in the field has stated recently that a new breed of prompt-based AI applications might be designed in shorter and easier fashions \parencite{YouTube_2023} and this study will provide an example of that. Altogether, a new wave of LLMs-based AI applications is emerging, with many possible applications already speculated to become influential in the near to mid future.\parencite{bommasani_opportunities_2022}.

In the field of education, the rise of Information and Communication Technologies has reshaped and enriched the educational landscape for decades \parencite{higgins_impact_2012}. Digitalization has led to the integration of programming and technology courses in schools, as well as innovative learning approaches, such as maker education \parencite{blikstein2013digital}. More recently, AI-based systems and tools have been extensively integrated in administration, instruction, and learning \parencite{chen_application_2020} and a growing body of research around AI in Education (AIEd) is laying the foundations for a new specific sub-field of AI research \parencite{niemi_ai_2023}. 

Nevertheless, while technology offers many tools and opportunities, its presence isn't a guarantee of improved educational experiences, and similar observations have been made for interventions involving AI \parencite{holmes_state_2022}.  A deeper understanding of how students interact with technological tools can support the design of enhanced specific educational tools and promote favorable outcomes." 

Furthermore, debates have arisen regarding the adequacy of our previous approaches to digital technologies in understanding Human-AI interactions, both in general use and in learning environments . One of such approaches centers on the research around \textit{Computational Thinking}. Originally intended to describe specific competencies in programming, its definition has since evolved and sparked debate. While some regard it as a universal skill useful for numerous tasks in our digital society \parencite{wing_computational_2006}, there is ongoing discussion on its definition and measurements \parencite{MorenoLen2018OnCT} . Additionally, the underlying nature of AI has triggered major changes in computation that demands for an updated understanding for the Computational Thinking framework, particularly in the educational landscape due to its current influence in curriculum design\parencite{tedre_ct_2021}. 

Yet, within both the AIEd and Computational Thinking body of research there is a notable absence of educational specialists representation, a scarcity of qualitative and mixed-methods studies, and a limited variety in data gathering approaches. Particularly relevant is the lack of experiences in physical learning environments and objectives that extend beyond just enhancing students' academic performance \parencite{zawacki-richter_systematic_2019, holmes_state_2022, grover_computational_2013}. 

This study focuses on exploring the use of Large Language Models, in this case GPT-4, for the co-creation of personalized case scenarios in a Higher Education course and its connections with Computational Thinking Skills. It also aims to engage educational specialists in speculative reflection about the future of AI in education. Our research not only aims to pave the way for innovative designs that enrich and personalize physical learning experiences using AI tools but also to inspire deeper exploration into the vast potentials of integrating AI in educational settings.

\subsection{Large Language Models}\label{Large Language Models}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Capabilities

GPT (Generative Pre-Trained) language models are a particular class of AI systems, distinguished by their capability of generating human-like text from a given prompt. They are able to perform a variety of tasks, from translation to text summarization and question answering, often surpassing than human-average performance \parencite{srivastava_beyond_2022}.  As the volume of training data and trained model parameters has increased, their adaptability to tasks beyond their initial training scope has expanded impressively.  Notably, GPT-3 can adapt to new tasks using an approach known as \textit{In-context learning}---relying on natural language descriptions of the task---an ability that it's predecessor, GPT-2 (with fewer training parameters and data) struggles to perform consistently \parencite{bommasani_opportunities_2022, wei_emergent_2022}. GPT-4 has further improved current capabilities in every measured metric so far \parencite{openai2023gpt4}. Current benchmarks, however,  appear to be insufficient in fully measuring it's capabilities. They rely mostly on syntactic accuracy, overlooking the nuanced semantic value of the generated texts \parencite{bubeck_sparks_2023}.  The evolution of GPT, combined with the widespread use of its free chatbot application, ChatGPT, and debate about it's intelligence, or lack of it, has garnered substantial public attention, and the novelty effects on its applications and public reactions can't be underestimated.

  \item Prompt-based applications (maybe just a short mention in the capabilities, since there is not much references on this)

\end{itemize}

y have been able to engage efficiently into tasks that were extend beyond their originally intended use or training purposes.
